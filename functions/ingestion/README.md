## FYI: Semi-sensitive information
The ingestion function logs on to a sftp server to retrieve client data and send it to the firestore database.  If you would like to work on this code there are two things you will have to do first:

1. Sign a [Confidientiality Agreement](https://github.com/codeforbtv/paperwork/blob/master/cvoeo/_blankForms/CVOEO%20Confidentiality%20Agreement.pdf) and give it to Katrina
1. Get a copy of the .runtimeconfig.json file with the sftp credentials from Micah or Irit
